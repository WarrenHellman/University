Started by applying style to our dynamic list in section 4

Added dynamic styling using Javascript to our cards.

Installed radium package to the project. This package lets us use pseudo selectors inside of the javascript pages of the project. To use it, we import it to a file and wrap the export inside of the package element e.g. export default Radium(App); This is known as a higher level component and works on functional components and higher level components. 

  -Pseudo properties can now be added to our inline styling like a normal element

    ':hover': {
        backgroundColor: 'lightgreen',
        color: 'black'
  -They can also be added externally to our inline style object 

    style[':hover'] = {
        backgroundColor: 'lightgreen',
        color: 'black'
      }

  If you want to use keyframes or media queries, import { StyleRoot } from radium and wrap your final JSX application in it to apply the change. 

    -Here is an example of inline style of media query on our person component:

      const style = {
        '@media (min-width: 500px)': {
        width: '450px'
      }
